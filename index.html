        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p>
            We have been operating this business since November of 2005. Tai Hong Restaurant has always been a Chinese restaurant since the 70s. In 2000, myself and my husband came to visit while we were working at Wongs House Restaurant in Holyrood, and we really liked this place. We loved the view, the oriental design of the restaurant, and we really loved the location. We even said that it would be nice if we could own it. We moved to Ottawa after I graduated with a Business degree from MUN in 2001. My husband was a cook in Ottawa for a few years, and he wanted to own his own restaurant. After we were told that the last owner wanted to sell Tai Hong restaurant, we decided right away to move back without having second thoughts. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We have renovated and have a new, larger buffet than ever!
            <br>
            <br>
            I was a salesperson in Ottawa for a few years, and I gained great experience in customer service. With my husband's experience in cooking, I always believed that having good food and good service would ensure happy customers.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the last few years, our business has been growing every year. Most of our customers come back after the first visit and become regulars. Some of them have even become our friends. 
            <br>
            <br>
            With this new website, we hope that our customers can give us some reviews and opinions after their visit so we can improve and serve our customers better.
